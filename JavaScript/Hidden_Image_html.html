            <li>A sudden cut to Gojo in the afterlife</li>
            <li>His body being seen cut in half</li>
            <li>Gojo's death was necessary for the plot to progress, allowing the next generation of sorcerers to step up and for the story to explore themes of loss and responsibility. </li>

            <li>Sukuna made the same mistake toji did which was not cutting his head off.</li>
            <li> His brain was transferred into Yuta's body, and there's a possibility of his return. </li>
            <li>The series ended without a definitive confirmation of Gojo's death, leaving his fate ambiguous</li>
