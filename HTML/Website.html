        <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2> 
        <img src = "https://oca-wp-journals.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2229/2021/10/Untitled-1024x791.png">
        <p><i>The Feynman Technique</i> is a learning method where you explain a concept in simple terms, as if teaching it to a child, identifying knowledge gaps and refining your understanding through simplification and analogies. Here's a breakdown: <br> <b>1. Choose a Concept:</b> Select a topic you want to learn or improve your understanding of. <br> <b>2. Explain in Simple Terms:</b> Write down your current understanding of the concept, as if you were explaining it to someone with no prior knowledge. <br> <b>3. Identify Gaps:</b> As you explain, you'll likely encounter areas where your understanding is weak or incomplete. </br> <b>4. Review and Refine:</b> Go back to your source material and fill in those knowledge gaps, then rewrite your explanation to be even simpler and more accurate. <br> <b>5. Simplify and Analogize:</b> Continue to simplify your explanation and use analogies to make the concept easier to grasp and remember.</p>
        
        <div><h2>The Pomodoro Technique</h2>
        <p><i>The Pomodoro Technique</i> is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro. Here's a breakdown: <br><b> 1. Choose a Task: </b> Select a specific task you want to focus on. <br> <b>2. Set a 25-Minute Timer:</b> Use a timer (physical or digital) and set it for 25 minutes. <br> <b>3. Work on the Task:</b> Focus solely on the chosen task for the entire 25 minutes, minimizing distractions. <br><b> 4. Take a Short Break:</b> Once the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. <br><b> 5. Repeat and Longer Break:</b> Repeat steps 1-4 for a total of four "Pomodoros" (25-minute work intervals), then take a longer break (15-30 minutes) before starting another cycle. </p>
